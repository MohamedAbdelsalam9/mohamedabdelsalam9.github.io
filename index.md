# Mohamed Ashraf Abdelsalam

I am currently doing a Master of Research in Machine Learning at 
<a href="mila.quebec/en/"> Mila </a> and University of Montreal, where I am supervised by <a href="http://sarathchandar.in/">Dr. Sarath Chandar </a>. In 2018, I obtained my Bachelor degree in Aerospace Engineering from <a href="https://zewailcity.edu.eg/">Zewail University of Science and Technology</a>.

## Research
My researsh interests are generally broad within the field of machine learning and deep learning. My current focus is in the area of incremental learning and how the models should be smarter in accumulating new knowledge and learning new tasks without forgetting previous knowledge and experience, even when data for these previous tasks is not there or is very limited.
